All features and more information on Gitty are available in the [the docs](https://github.com/lianstuder/gitty/blob/master/docs/README.md).

## Build from source

Since gitty is written in Crystal, you will need to have the Crystal compiler installed. For now, this makes gitty only available on Linux or in a WSL. You can learn more on WSL [here]().
To install Crystal, go to [the Crystal website](https://crystal-lang.org/install) and follow the instructions there.

If you installed the Crystal compiler, you can run `make build && make install` in the downloaded folder to build and install gitty. That's everything you need to do!
